# Problem Discovery Log

**Session:** [timestamp]
**Status:** [In Progress / Complete]

---

## Initial Request

**What the user asked for:**
[Original problem statement or feature request]

**Initial classification:**
- Type: [Solution / Problem / Unclear]
- Confidence that this is the real need: [%]

---

## Discovery Process

### Turn 1: Understanding the Goal
**Question asked:**
[Question posed to user]

**Answer received:**
[User response]

**Insight gained:**
[What this taught us about the real problem]

---

### Turn 2: Detecting Assumptions
**Question asked:**
[Question]

**Answer received:**
[Response]

**Insight gained:**
[What we learned]

---

### Turn 3: 5 Whys Analysis
**Initial symptom:**
[What user is experiencing]

**Why #1:** [Question and answer]
**Why #2:** [Question and answer]
**Why #3:** [Question and answer]
**Why #4:** [Question and answer]

**Root cause hypothesis:**
[Where the 5 Whys led us]

---

### Turn 4: Validation
**Question asked:**
[Confirming question]

**Answer received:**
[Confirmation or correction]

**Validated:**
- [ ] Yes, this is the real problem
- [ ] Actually, the problem is [different]

---

## XY Problem Analysis

**Was this an XY problem?**
- [ ] Yes - user asked for X, actually needed Y
- [ ] No - original request matched the problem
- [ ] Partially - original request was part of solution but missed root cause

**Evidence:**
[What made us think this was/wasn't XY?]

---

## Final Problem Statement

### The Real Problem
[Definitive statement of what we're actually solving]

### Why the Original Solution Might Not Work
[Explanation of why asking for X doesn't fix the root problem]

### What Solving This Enables
[Business value or user outcome]

### Who's Actually Affected
[Specific users or roles experiencing this problem]

---

## Constraints & Context Discovered

During discovery, we also learned:

**Technical Constraints:**
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

**Business Constraints:**
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

**User Context:**
- [User characteristic 1]
- [User characteristic 2]

---

## Discovery Metrics

- **Turns needed:** [N]
- **Root cause found:** [Yes/No]
- **User confirmed problem:** [Yes/No]
- **Quality improvement:** [Initial vagueness → Final clarity]
- **Time to root cause:** [estimate]

---

## Lessons Learned

What question was most revealing?
[Best question that changed understanding]

What assumption did we get wrong?
[Most surprising discovery]

Would we ask this differently next time?
[Reflection on discovery process effectiveness]

---

## Transition to Refinement

**Ready to proceed?**
- [ ] Yes - problem is clear, user confirmed
- [ ] No - need more discovery
- [ ] Blocked - can't proceed without more information

**Next action:**
Context gathering phase will now search for:
1. [Related code to find]
2. [Documentation to review]
3. [Patterns to identify]
